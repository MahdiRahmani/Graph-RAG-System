# Graph-RAG System Implementation
## Overview
This repository contains a step-by-step implementation of a Graph-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using Python. The project is based on the article [Building a Graph-RAG System: A Step-by-Step Approach](https://machinelearningmastery.com/building-graph-rag-system-step-by-step-approach/), which provides insights into building a graph-based retrieval system using vector embeddings, graph construction, and graph-based vector search.

## Prerequisites
+ Python 3.10

+ equired Python packages:
  + llama-index
  + graspologic
  + numpy==1.24.4
  + scipy==1.12.0

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph-rag-system.git
cd graph-rag-system
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
